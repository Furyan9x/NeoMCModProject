# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- Project setup and basic structure established
- Core mod registration and initialization
- Weight system capability framework (functionally complete and stable)
- Sophisticated Backpacks integration for capacity bonus via JSON tags
- Item tooltips for weight and capacity bonus
- Handler registration and deregistration for backpacks is robust
- Debounce/cooldown system prevents weight calculation spam
- Backpack movement between inventory and curio slots maintains functionality
- Basic networking infrastructure
- Custom item registration

## What's Left to Build
- Performance profiling and optimization (top priority)
- UI tracking: Encumbrance icon, color, and stats display that updates on all relevant events
- Compatibility/integration with other mods (Small Ships, Immersive Aircraft, Create: Steam n Rails, etc.)
- Custom enchantment or upgrade item for increasing max capacity (must work with JSON-driven system)
- Expand faction system
  - Faction commands and permissions
  - Faction territory mechanics
  - Faction benefits and progression
- Custom GUI elements for RPG features
- Integration with Project MMO for skills
- Economic systems and trade mechanics
- Transport systems (ships, aircraft, mounts)
- Combat role mechanics and balancing
- Region-specific resource distribution

## Current Status
Weight system is stable and feature-complete for current requirements. Major bugs are resolved. Focus is shifting to performance optimization, UI/UX improvements, and cross-mod compatibility.

## Known Issues
- Need to ensure weight system is compatible with other inventory mods
- Faction system requires persistence and synchronization refinement
- Cross-mod integration planning still in early stages

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Started with basic feature set to establish core architecture
- Focusing on capability-based systems for extensibility, but attachment and data component systems should also be considered where possible
- Prioritizing the weight and faction systems as foundation for RPG mechanics
- Planning data-driven approach for easier balancing and configuration

The mod is entering a new phase focused on optimization, UI/UX, and integration. The foundation is now stable, enabling confident addition of new features and compatibility work.
