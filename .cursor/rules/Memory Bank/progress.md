# Progress Tracking

## What Works
- Project setup and basic structure established
- Core mod registration and initialization
- Weight system capability framework
- Faction system capability framework
- Basic networking infrastructure
- Custom item registration

## What's Left to Build
- Complete weight system functionality
  - Container item weight integration
  - Weight effects on player movement
  - Weight UI elements
- Expand faction system
  - Faction commands and permissions
  - Faction territory mechanics
  - Faction benefits and progression
- Custom GUI elements for RPG features
- Integration with Project MMO for skills
- Economic systems and trade mechanics
- Transport systems (ships, aircraft, mounts)
- Combat role mechanics and balancing
- Region-specific resource distribution

## Current Status
Initial development phase - core systems are being established but most gameplay features are still pending implementation. The project structure follows Neoforge standards and includes capability/attachment/data component systems for extending entity functionality

## Known Issues
- Need to ensure weight system is compatible with other inventory mods
- Faction system requires persistence and synchronization refinement
- Cross-mod integration planning still in early stages

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Started with basic feature set to establish core architecture
- Focusing on capability-based systems for extensibility, but attachment and data component systems should also be considered where possible
- Prioritizing the weight and faction systems as foundation for RPG mechanics
- Planning data-driven approach for easier balancing and configuration
