# Project Context

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to transform Minecraft 1.21.1 (using Neoforge) into a RuneScape-style RPG modpack with inspirations from Archeage. It's a hobby project developed for the creator and their son, with the potential to evolve into a multiplayer server if the development progresses well.

## Problems It Solves
- Enhances Minecraft's gameplay by adding rich RPG elements and skill-based progression
- Creates a more immersive economic system with region-locked resources and meaningful transport mechanics
- Implements a more engaging combat system with roles (Tank/Healer/DPS)
- Provides a cooperative gameplay experience focused on dungeon and group play

## How It Should Work
The mod should seamlessly integrate with Minecraft while adding:
- Multi-skill leveling system (via Project MMO & Project MMO:Classes)
- Weighted inventory system that makes resource transportation meaningful
- Varied travel options (ships, aircraft, trains, mounts)
- Integrated combat mechanics that support different player roles
- Region-specific resources to encourage exploration and trade

## User Experience Goals
- Immersive RPG experience within the Minecraft universe
- Satisfying progression through skill advancement and gear unlocks
- Meaningful economic interactions with value-added resource chains
- Engaging cooperative gameplay that encourages different playstyles
- Balanced integration of various mods to create a cohesive experience
