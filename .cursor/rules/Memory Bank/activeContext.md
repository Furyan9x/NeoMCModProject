# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Refactoring and optimizing the weight system for inventory management
- Implementing a centralized approach to backpack integration with Sophisticated Backpacks
- Enhancing event handling and improving performance
- Consolidating weight-related code for better maintainability

## Recent Changes
- Completed major weight system refactoring to improve organization and reduce duplication
- Centralized backpack handling in the BackpackWeightHandlerManager class
- Removed BackpackPickupHandler class and consolidated its functionality
- Added proper weight logging to help debugging and testing
- Implemented WeightSystemManager for coordinated system management
- Enhanced UUID tracking for backpack movement between slots

## Next Steps
- Thoroughly test the refactored weight system in-game
- Check for proper backpack handler registration during various operations
- Verify backpack movement tracking between different inventory/curio slots
- Ensure weight calculations are correctly handled for backpacks in all locations
- Test shift-right-click and other special interactions with backpacks

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Balance between detailed logging and performance impact
- Clear separation of responsibilities between system components
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown to prevent memory leaks
- Efficient cache invalidation to maintain accurate weight calculations
- Handling of edge cases like player death, dimension travel, and server restarts

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Centralized management of backpack handlers
- Event-driven communication between system components
- UUID-based tracking for unique backpack identification
- Comprehensive logging for testing and debugging
- Clear separation of responsibilities between event handlers

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Improved approach to handler registration/unregistration
- More efficient weight calculation with reduced redundancy
- Enhanced cache management techniques
- Better organization of system components and events
- Proper resource cleanup for improved memory management
