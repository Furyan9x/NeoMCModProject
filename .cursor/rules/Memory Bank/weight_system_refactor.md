# Weight System Refactoring

## Summary of Changes

We've extensively refactored the weight system to improve organization, reduce code duplication, and fix several issues related to backpack handling. The main changes include:

1. **Centralized Backpack Management**
   - Moved all backpack-related handling to the `BackpackWeightHandlerManager` class
   - Added methods for handling backpack pickup, finding backpacks in player inventory, and managing handlers

2. **Simplified Event Handlers**
   - Consolidated event handling by removing `BackpackPickupHandler` class
   - Enhanced `WeightEventHandler` to handle block breaks and item pickups more efficiently
   - Streamlined `ContainerEventHandler` to focus specifically on slot changes

3. **Added System-Level Management**
   - Created `WeightSystemManager` to coordinate system-wide tasks
   - Added proper cleanup on server shutdown to prevent memory leaks
   - Improved backpack handler registration/unregistration

4. **Improved UUID Tracking**
   - Now using backpack UUID for tracking instead of multiple hash methods
   - Added more efficient handler for finding backpacks across different inventory locations
   - Reduced cooldown spam during backpack operations

5. **Reduced Redundancy**
   - Removed duplicate code for handling backpacks across multiple classes
   - Centralized weight calculation to prevent unnecessary recalculations
   - Improved cache management to prevent excessive invalidation

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Reduced unnecessary recalculations and cache invalidations
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation of responsibilities between classes
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Proper tracking of backpacks as they move between inventory slots
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Centralized common functionality
- **Better Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of handlers and caches

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the refactored system with various backpack operations
2. **Performance Profiling**: Measure the impact of these changes on system performance
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
4. **Feature Improvements**: Consider adding quality-of-life features now that the foundation is solid
