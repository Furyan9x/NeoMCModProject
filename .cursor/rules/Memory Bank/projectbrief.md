1. Project Overview

    Goal: Transform Minecraft 1.21.1 (Neoforge) into a RuneScape-style RPG modpack with inspirations from Archeage.

    Audience: Hobby project for me and my son, but may eventually start a multiplayer server if we do good enough work!

2. Core Objectives

    Skill-Based Progression:

        Leverage Project MMO & Project MMO:Classes for multi-skill leveling.

        Unlock new equipment, training areas, mobs/dungeons as players level.

    Economic & Transport Systems:

        Inventory Weight: Region-locked resources + large biomes to give merit to hauling.

        Emergent Economy: Raw resources gain value through transport, crafting, and trading.

        Travel Options:

            Limited “fast travel/teleportation.”

            Small Ships / boat mod; Immersive Aircraft / plane mod; Create-based trains; mounts & breeding.

3. Mod Ecosystem & Integrations

    Core Mods:

        Project MMO + Classes

        Create + Create Addons

        Iron Spells & Spellbooks + Addons

        Apotheosis + Addons

        Sophisticated Backpacks

        Ars Noveau + Addons

        Better Combat

        MineColonies + Addons


    Integration Tasks:

        Ensure cross-mod compatibility and seemless integration between all of our systems and other mods.


4. Gameplay Scope & Balance

    PvP: TBD—likely disabled initially due to combat complexity; focus on co-op dungeon/group play.

    Cooperative Roles:

        Tank / Healer / DPS roles incentivized by skill/class choices.

    Economy Inspiration:

        Explicitly reference RuneScape & ArcheAge mechanics: resource gathering, regional trade hubs, gear markets.

5. AI Agent Persona & Expectations

    Persona: Expert Java coder / game-systems engineer.

    Coding Standard:

        Performant, idiomatic NeoForge/Minecraft 1.21.1 code.

        Clear separation of concerns, modular data-driven systems.
